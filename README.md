Building a Rag Application using Langchain

This is an intelligent chatbot application that allows you to upload and have a conversation with your PDF documents. Built with Streamlit and LangChain, it uses Google's Gemini model and a FAISS vector store to provide accurate, context-aware answers with source citations, and it uses HuggingFace to generate embeddings. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

The application follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow to ensure that the answers are based on factual data from the PDF document

1. **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit, the application provides a user-friendly and responsive chat interface.
2. **Multi-Chat Management:** Start new conversations or switch between previous chat sessions, all managed in the sidebar.
3. **Conversational Memory:** The chatbot understands the context of follow-up questions for a natural, flowing conversation.
4. **Verifiable Answers:** Each response includes citations, showing the page number and a snippet from the original PDF.
5. **Automated Evaluation:** An integrated evaluation system uses an "LLM-as-a-judge" to score the chatbot's accuracy against a set of test questions.
6. **Modular Codebase:** The code is structured into separate modules for the UI (app.py) and core logic in the src folder, making it easy to maintain and extend.
